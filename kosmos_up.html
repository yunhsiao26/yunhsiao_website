                <h6 class="kosmos_up_color">Support clinical usage, align with new branding, and involve usability issues to address.</h6>

              <p>
                Initially, KOSMOS UP only served students and faculties in medical schools. As the company expanded the service area to clinical usage, we wanted to build a new product which was similar to 
                the existing product – Kosmos UP Education, but it could <b>better support clinical use cases – “Kosmos UP Clinical.”</b>
              </p>    
    
              <p>
                When I got looped in in an early stage, I found that the project scope was very ambiguous, so I <b>worked together with the PM to clarify the scope</b> that we should <b>focus on for the MVP and for the future, based on the market needs.</b>
              </p>    
    
              <p>
                It happened that the company created a new branding guideline for marketing usage months before the project got kicked off, so my design partners and I followed the concept, typeface, and theme colors to <b>develop a new design guideline for the new product</b>. 
              </p>    

              <p>
                I also found that there were many issues found in the previous free trials to our potential customers in the industry that were not covered in the scope, so I advocated to <b>include usability improvement in the MVP</b> 
                as well, including the major issues in navigation, search, and input interaction.
              </p>

                <p>
                  To efficiently drive the project and ensure the new features could <b>align with our business goals and the design is feasible</b>, I came up with a strategy, starting with <b>understanding our target users</b>, 
                  and then working closely with other designers, PM, physicians, and developers to <b>define product roadmap</b>, and ideating and iterating potential solutions.

            <p class="paragraph_below_image">
              Based on my previous experience, different sonography professionals may have different opinions on what and how to support, so I suggested the team to <b>apply focus group combining with participatory design method</b> 
              to engage physicians and other project stakeholders to <b>find the sweet spot among desirability, viability and feasibility</b>.
            </p>    


            <p>
              Through this method, we could engage the professionals throughout the process so that they could help us <b>better define the scope, provide feedback, and discuss different opinions sufficiently with the team</b>.
            </p>    


            <p>
              During the process, around 8 physicians were involved, and we have run over 60 sessions so far.

                <p>
                  Exam browse and search are the key functionalities in this service. With my suggestion, my teammates and I <b>focused more on information architecture first, and then polished interaction and visual design in later stages</b>. 
                  To ensure the desirability, visbility and feasibility of the design, I went through multiple iterations.  
                </p>   

                <p>
                  I started with reviewing the previous design to see if there is any non-ideal parts to be changed and good ideas we could borrow from.

          In the original design, after users login, they would see an exam table view for them to browse through all the exams they have, and users could click on a row to review the exam details. We also had a “Portfolio” feature 
          with which users could collect their interested cases in different folders.
        </p>   

        <p>
          The main confusing part was that users had a hard time telling that the same exam in two categories were connected to the same data point in the database. They were <b>not clear that an action applied to an exam in their 
          portfolios would influence this exam globally</b>. Therefore, <b>how might we support the same functionality but change the UI design to enhance user comprehension and smooth navigation?</b>

                            As for the navigation itself, in the original design, we divided information into 6 main categories and each had a main page that users could access through the global navigation bar. There was also a

                            Original filter features could allow users to filter particular columns of the exam table, and save a set of filters to reuse again, but it was not so convenient as keyword search, and showing all the filters 
                            by default was a little bit overwhelming. Therefore, I persuaded the team to <b>support keyword search</b>. The interaction design of my early exploration – advanced search features required users to type 
                            a query first, and to click “add” button and select filter type, which was not preferred. Later, I <b>placed the “show filter” button on the first layer and made it always accessible</b>. In this way, users could 
                            easily access filter features, but have a clean screen without getting distracted by many filters by default.

                            To support both operators and reviewers to know the current status of an exam, I added one more column for exam status in the exam table. In the beginning, a progress bar was used to present three different 
                            statuses – New exam, Exam in review, and Exam published. Based on physicians' feedback, the visual representation was confusing and three statuses might not be enough. Therefore, I tried ideating different 
                            potential solutions, including using little dots to represent steps and using text and color code. I <b>differentiated different statuses with different colors for particular roles</b>, so when users browse through

                            more intuitive and 4 steps were sufficient. I also found that having <b>status explanation was very helpful</b>, so eventually we moved forward with the option.

                  Once users got what they were looking for, they would come to the exam review. It is the main page for each exam in the second layer of the web portal. 
                </p>   

                <p>
                  In the original version, users could see <b>a large imaging view and thumbnails of images and clips</b> collected in this exam. They could edit the current image with annotation features aside. 
                  They could also grade each image, and show the annual and AI grading information of each image as an overview on top. We also <b>supported operators to fill in report, and reviewers to review 
                  and comment</b> on the platform. When users open the sheets, there could be up to three presented on the screen.

          From physicians’ requirements, they did not really need the AI and manual grading comparison visualization of each image/clip, so I decided to remove it in the clinical version.
        </p>    


        <p>
          Based on previous design evaluation, I also learned that <b>clicking the action buttons on top to open report and review forms was not intuitive</b>, and <b>the layout for the sheets would cause long scroll 
          which was not easy for users to fill and review</b>. Therefore, how might we <b>support the smooth user flow and interaction of completing report and review forms</b> was my main focus in this page.

                            Based on physicians' feedback, although the small thumbnails could allow them to quickly browse through and view multiple images/clips at one time, it was hard to see image details 
                            to differentiate different images/clips. Therefore, I enlarged the thumbnails in the later version. I also polished the header section with <b>breadcrumb</b> (patient name for each exam plus exam ID tooltip) 
                            to support smoother navigation. Besides, I also found that physicians need to <b>comment on not only an exam as a whole but also each individual image/clip</b>, so I designed a comment feature to support

                  <p>
                    With Kosmos UP Clinical, we are able to break into the clinical market, and expanded the service scope to not only serving members in medical schools but also 
                    physicians working at small clinics and teaching hospitals.
                </p>    


                <p>
                  We also built a closer relationship with physicians in our network. By meeting weekly, we were able to involve sonography professionals in early design stages to 
                  collect feedback and reshape user-need-based requirements along the way. This strategy could be applied to other projects as well.
