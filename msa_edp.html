                        Microsoft Academic is a knowledge graph which supports <b>academic influence evaluation</b> and academic publication access <b>for academic institutions and researchers</b> (more than one million/month). 
                        There are six types of entities in this knowledge graph – publication, author, topic, conference, journal, and institution. <b>Each entity has a detail page for users to 
                        quickly grasp its development trend, impact, and the most related entities</b>. The team had abundant data to support researchers, which was much more 
                        than what was on the website, but they were not clear about how and what to present. Therefore, I tried to clarify the most desirable information to researchers, and figured 
                        out <b>an efficient and engaging way to present a large amount of data that can be consistently applied across all entity detail pages</b>. Also, readability issues regarding 
                        typography were addressed along the way.

                    <p>
                       Through previous user studies and discussions with PMs, I realized that Microsoft Academic website was <b>serving researchers across various career stages and fields with different needs</b>. 
                       The target users could be categorized into five main groups – Institutional Researchers, PhD Candidates, Post Doc, Under Grads, and Institution Admins (university, company, journal, government, etc.). 
                       With this understanding and the above requirements, I <b>utilized brainstorming sessions with PMs to make assumptions on information that different types of users care about</b>. We started 
                       with the topic entity, and then expand the scope to the other five entities – publication, author, conference, journal, and institution.

                    <p>
                      Based on the assumptions, I constructed contents for each EDP with spreadsheets, and iterated on them together with PMs. I marked those new contents that had not been presented on the webpages to remind myself.

                      In addition to the relatedness of entities, the "senses" were also used in computing the relatedness of medical topics, but in this project, we only focused 
                      on the general ones for entities and planned to tackle the medical ones in future stages.

                     <p>
                        To guarantee the usability and feasibility of the new design, I went through multiple rounds of iteration. Below are four key changes that were made along the way:

                                   Regarding the layout of the hero area, I tried to group relevant information with cards in the beginning, <b>placed the impact-related info right below the entity name to 
                                   take care of the reading path, and made the icon and text style of action buttons consistent</b>. Based on team members' feedback, authors and institutions would be used 
                                   to differentiate publications along with venue info, so I placed them closer to the title in the second version. <b>The order of sections was also adjusted based on the 
                                   importance and frequency of usage</b>. Besides, <b>other EDP versions and those with more and less content on cards in left and right columns were created</b>. The design could 
                                   work in various cases, but the interaction would look wired and hard to implement if we expect the cards in the left and right columns share the same height no 
                                   matter the content is expanded or not. In addition, it was arguable that without applying the card visual treatment to author, institution, venue, and impact info made the top 
                                   area inconsistent with other parts. Therefore, we eventually discarded the card design, but kept the idea of <b>adding section titles to create visual hierarchy</b> 
                                   and added the entity icon back in front of the entity title to help users quickly tell the entity type.

                                        While working on the layout, I also fixed visual style issues along the way. In addition to color issues which had been addressed in the <a class="hover_extra_link" href="http://yunhsiao.space/msa_topic_filter.html">Topic Filter</a> 
                                        project, icons in the website sharing different styles required to be updated as well. Based on discussions with PMs, <b>existing icons were serving as identifications for different entities and features</b>. <b>Users might

                                        were tackled as well. Besides, <b>for entity icons, I also explored another set of possibilities for future reference</b>. When there is a good timing to change icons, those can be taken into consideration.

                                    To support users to <b>efficiently view highly related entities, easily comprehend how relatedness was generated, and see the relatedness based on their desired "senses,"</b> I created multi-sense data visualizations 
                                    with different "sense" selections. When users selected a "sense" to see the related entities, a corresponding visualization for the "sense" would be shown below for user reference. For this visualization, 
                                    I placed "author" between "institution/conference/journal" and "publication" since "author" was the bridge between these two. However, PMs pointed out that users did not need to see this extra info to comprehend 
                                    the concept, so we removed it and make the visualization simpler in the second version. Owing to the content expansion, an "incoming and outgoing citation" visualization was added to the same tab 
                                    (the Related tab). At that time, we were unable to support filtering citations based on "senses." Therefore, I eventually <b>changed the design from applying the "sense" filter to the whole tab into a new one just for 
                                    each multi-sense data visualization section</b>.
