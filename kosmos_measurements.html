                    <p>
                       KOSMOS is a <b>point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) service combining AI technologies to facilitate ultrasound scans and focus on cardiac disease diagnosis</b>.  
                       In this product, the existing measurement features were quite basic. They were far from other traditional ultrasound products, in which particular measurements and corresponding 
                       calculations for different body portions and organs were supported. Therefore, as the expansion of the product, we wanted to <b>build advanced measurement features</b> for cardiologists 
                       to collect accurate cardiac calculations <b>to better support the diagnosis of a patient's heart condition</b>.

                    <p>
                    Usually, in a point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) product, the live imaging view was designed for users to acquire their desired images, and its cine review was for instant annotations. 
                    KOSMOS was no exception. There were some <b>basic measurement features</b> such as length, circumference, area, etc., and annotations such as text and marker that were provided in the system. 
                    Users could <b>edit the acquired images/clips instantly right in the cine review, or afterward in the edit view of the exam review</b>. At that time, we were hoping to improve the funictionalities 
                    of the product <b>to support physicians, cardiologists, and cardiac sonographers (our target user groups) to efficiently know if a patient's heart is healthy and functionally work well</b>, so we wanted to <b>build
                    more advanced cardiac measurement and calculation features</b>.

                    This project was a little bit different from others I had previously. In the beginning, <b>the scope was quite ambiguous</b> without clear timeline and process to follow. The team had very 
                    limited knowledge about cardiac measurements and had no clear idea about which measurements to support and which should be given higher priorities. Therefore, after discussing with the PM, 
                    I got two main goals to achieve:

                    I clarified that from business perspective, the primary users of cardiac measurement and calculation features were <b>cardiologists</b> who conduct research or run private practice, and secondary users 
                    were <b>medical students</b> who are learning cardiac scanning and diagnosis and <b>rural physicians</b> who conduct rural or telemedicine. Based on their needs, in addition to acquiring images/clips,

                     <p>
                        With the above discussed directions, my first step was to clarify the project scope. With the PM's help, I had opportunities to talk with several cardiologists and cardiac sonographers in our network 
                        to <b>collect a couple of basic measurements to start with</b>. 
                     </p>    

                     <p>
                        By reading some echocardiography textbooks and articles, I was able to <b>gain basic knowledge in cardiac measurements</b> to support myself and the team's future work. Through reading the user guides 
                        of other ultrasound products in the market, watching online cardiac scanning videos, and operating other competitor's products, I was able to learn which measurements in the market were supported, 
                        and <b>how user flow and interactions for cardiac measurements could be designed</b>. By presenting the summary of what I learned from the research, I was able to <b>help ​the team gain sufficient background

                   In this early stage, I <b>explored two main user flow approaches: free flow, and protocol-driven flow</b>. In the free flow, users could acquire images/clips first, 
                   and chose the measurements needed later. They could conduct the measurements instantly in the cine review or afterward in the exam review. They could also 
                   convert a regular measurement into a particular measurement.
                </p>    
                

                <p>
                    While in the protocol-driven flow, we supposed that users already knew what they wanted to conduct in the very beginning, so they would choose a measurement type first 
                    before starting acquiring images/clips. This idea was inspired by what we already had for Ejection Fraction measurements in the system.

    Next, we thought it could be a good timing to start collecting feedback from our users, so I <b>created mid-fi wireframes combining with the user flow diagram to present to cardiac sonographers in our network</b>. 
    In this diagram, more complex scenarios such as conducting multiple measurements across different views and clips to generate calculations were involved.

    <p>
    From the user feedback, I got four main takeaways:
    </p>


    <table class="a">
        <tr>
            <td class="column01"><p><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></p></td>
            <td class="column02"><p>A particular measurement would not be used independently. Users would use a whole calculation package instead, so we should <b>provide measurement packages</b> instead of independent measurements for users to choose.</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><p><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></p></td>
            <td><p>The free flow had higher flexibility which made more sense to users because they might need to conduct a set of measurements during the scan, but they might not know it before starting an exam. 
                   Therefore, we would get rid of the protocol-driven flow and <b>go with the free flow option</b>.</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><p><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></p></td>
            <td><p>Converting a regular measurement into a particular measurement was not a common use case and it would take effort to manage and implement, so we could de-prioritize this functionality.</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><p><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></p></td>
            <td><p>For some measurement packages, <b>measurements would be conducted within different clips and different modes</b>, so this complex scenario might need to be covered in the future as well.</p></td>
        </tr>
      </table>    


          <p>
            Besides, using AI to support view selection and caliper placing would be very helpful for users, but after talking with the AI team, we realized that it would took time and effort to implement. 
            Therefore, for the first release, everything would be manual, but AI-assistant measurements could be a direction to work on in the future.
          </p>


          <p>
            Through multiple rounds of discussion, I was also able to <b>clarify the requirements for the new features and listed down potential solutions accordingly</b>.

                      In addition to the design direction, I also clarify the project scope parallelly. Through the above mentioned research, I found over 200 cardiac measurements and calculations across different scan modes. 
                      To define which measurements to give priorities to, I <b>reached out to over 10 physicians and cardiac sonographers</b>.

                    <p>
                      By continually discussing with the PM and sonography professionals and through multiple iterations, I eventually narrowed down the scope to <b>the most frequently used ones (around 20)</b> and generated 
                      the list to support. The measurement packages in the B mode (the brightness scan mode) were given higher priorities which would be implemented in the first release.

                                    I also found that users would <b>choose a qualified view first, and placed all the calipers belonging to one particular view in the same view</b>, so I modified the user flow by giving a <b>view

                                    Cine bar was a control for users to review an acquired clip. Users could use the left and right fences to pick a desired range to save. For the package with <b>measurements 
                                    required in diastolic and systolic views, users would conduct them in one cardiac cycle</b>. If users acquired a clip which was over a certain 
                                    length, the two views would be super close on the cine bar which made it hard to operate the set view controls. Also, because of the current cine bar design was not clean enough, we 
                                    took it as an opportunity to <b>improve the cine bar by refining the visual treatments and adding a zoom feature</b>. We learned that the speed control and the next/previous controls were not 
                                    used frequently in the scenario of conducting measurements, so we decided to remove them from the cine bars for measurements. Eventually, we ​figured out a new set of cine bars – one for 
                                    the regular cine review / exam review, the other for the clips with measurements. For the later one, users could adjust the begin and the end fences to select a range to zoom in.

                  <h6 class="kosmos_color">Facilitate data-supported cardiac diagnosis.</h6>
    
                  <p>
                      Based on the feedback from cardiac sonographers, the cardiac measurements and calculation features allowed them to conduct measurements more accurately and gain calculation values efficiently. 
                      With the numbers, they were able to quickly tell the issues from different ranges. One example was the measurements for the diameter of aorta root (AoR) and left atrium (LA). With the calculation 
                      LA/Ao value, physicians could estimate the increase in effective pulmonary blood flow since the ratio correlates significantly with increased pulmonary flow attributable to excessive transductal flow.
                  </p>    
  
                  <p>
                      Because of this project, we also built a closer relationship with sonographers in our network. The cooperation model of involving sonography professionals in early design stages and collecting feedback 
                      along the way could be applied to other projects in the future.
