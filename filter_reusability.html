                    <p>
                      F5XC (Distributed Cloud) is a SaaS-based security, networking, and application management console, on which we have multiple workspaces with different types of dashboards to support various protection 
                      and investigation. In each dashboard, users could utilize filters to narrow down the data and focus on a particular part that they care about most. In the original system, we did not have functionalities 
                      to support users <b>reapplying a set of filters or sharing a filtered view</b>, thus causing inconvenience in the communication between security engineers and technical account managers. We tried to solve this 
                      issue starting with the Bot Defense workspace, and figured out <b>a new design pattern as phase one that could be easily adjusted and adopted to all the workspaces in the console</b>.

                Bot Defense protects Internet applications from automated attacks. It identifies and mitigates malicious bots using telemetry collected from web and mobile endpoints, 
                and applies configurable mitigation actions to block or redirect harmful traffic before it reaches the application. It has been migrating from the SHAPE Security Platform (SPM) 
                to the F5XC console (to enable users to access multiple services through a single pane of glass) with the <b>improvement of information architecture, data organization and presentation, 
                and functionalities</b> to support better <b>self-serviceability</b>.

            Filtering is one of the most important functionalities that users need to use across the <b>stages of value awareness, diving deeper, reporting and investigation</b>. If the filter sets could be reusable,

            use dashboard and report pages frequently, and would co-work with our technical account managers (TAMs).

                During the design ideation and iteration process, I faced several challenges, the most complex and interesting of which included:
              </p>

             <p>
              The details of each will be introduced and explained in the sections below.
            </p>    
  


              <p>
                To <b>tackle the challenges and facilitate collaboration and communication</b> with project stakeholders, I implemented several strategies throughout the process:

                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td><p><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></p></td>
                    <td><p>Implementing a <b>bi-weekly recurring meeting to clarify requirements and user needs while collecting feedback from our subject matter experts (SMEs)</b> (including technical account managers (TAMs), 
                        data scientists, solution architects, PMs, etc.), whose insights are closely aligned with those of our clients/end-users.
                    </p></td>
                  </tr>

                  <tr>
                      <td><p><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></p></td>

                    </tr>
              </table>



                <p>
                  During the early ideation stage, I also explored various designs for inspiration. Some of the ideas I incorporated include:

                <p>
                  By utilizing recurring meetings and Maze, I <b>collected feedback from over 20 SMEs</b> to help rescope the project and make decisions on the logic design and information presentation.

                <p>
                  As mentioned above, I encountered several design challenges during the process. The below are the most complex and interesting ones:

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-12"> 
                <div class="item04" id="f5xc_page">

                    <table class="a">
                        <tr>
                          <td class="column06"><img src="img/icons_numbers/icons_number-52.png" class="icon_numbers" alt="Number 1"></td>

                              There was no existing component that could accommodate the new functionality, so we needed to propose a new one that could <b>meet the needs of Bot Defense and apply to other workspaces</b> in the console. 
                              I explored the idea of utilizing “filter icon” or “more action icon” as a control to show a dropdown menu, and with SMEs’ feedback of wanting to know which filter is currently applied, explored 
                              <b>presenting the saved filter name with status</b> on the first layer. In the second iteration, I moved the “Saved Filters” control to the first layer to make it stand out and easier to access, made 
                              the “Save” feature more dominant, and later figured out a way to <b>show all key controls in the first layer, in a more concise way</b>. I also added new functionalities, including the <b>“Return to Previous 
                              Status” control and the “Restore Defaults” control</b> to make the feature more user-friendly. The “save filter” logic was also polished – <b>only allow owners and admins to save (update) after editing 
                              a saved filter</b>. Others could only “save as” a new one.   
                          </p>
                        
                          <p>
                              Besides, I explored different information architecture design for the filter feature, and the <b>visual treatments for the edited part</b> of a saved filter. After consulting with the DS team, I realized it 
                              was a significant change that required more thinking and would take a long time, which would delay the release time. It might also not be able to be implemented in other workspaces simultaneously with 
                              the implementation of this project, which may lead to an inconsistency issue. Therefore, we did not go with this option for phase one.

                          <p>
                              During the exploration, I gained a deep understanding that although I was working on and responsible for Bot Defense, I was also <b>accountable for other workspaces</b>. Thus, I kept this in mind and <b>actively 
                              communicated with my PM to ensure we remained aligned</b>. This concept also shaped my decision to <b>involve the design system team in the feedback collection process and to approach design decisions from a more 
                              systematic perspective</b>.

                              Since filters could not be reused and used by others, and there was no option to delete expired filters, we aimed to develop a feature to address the issues, which information presentation and 
                              control required exploration. Some initial ideas I had included: presenting a saved filter list with an apply, a share by copy URL, and a delete control. In each page, <b>only presenting the filters 
                              that could be applied to that page</b>. Regarding filter naming rules, <b>allowing any characters (no input restriction), and allowing a name to be used only once in the same namespace (clients' user 
                              segmentation)</b>. Later with SMEs' feedback, I added a "Description" column to allow users to articulate the purposes of the filter set, and added a “Created by” column as a reference.
                          </p>

                              I also explored different ideas, such as allowing access to saved filters in different pages through a dropdown menu, viewing all filter values in an accordion, <b>dividing filters into “My Filters” & 
                              “Others” to support efficient navigation and access</b>, and presenting a delete feature in a side modeless or a management page. Eventually, we moved forward with a pattern that aligned with the design 
                              system and better met user needs.

                              The system only retained data in the past 30 days, so we needed to figure out a way to tackle the situation when the data was no longer available owing to the outdated time frame, either <b>the whole or 
                              part of the time expiration causes the whole or part of the data missing</b>. There were two types of time selection: generic (e.g., past X days), and custom (where users could pick a range in the past 30 
                              days). My initial idea for treatments was that for the <b>filters with a generic time frame, we kept it the same</b>. It would never expire. We would allow users to apply and show the corresponding results. 
                              As for the filters with a custom time frame, <b>when the partial or whole timeframe was out of 30 days, we would make the filter disabled without showing the apply or copy control</b>. I also utilized a warning 
                              icon to present time expiration messages to users in the filter list view, but I later realized that it required API call. We were unable to know if the time had expired or not right at this moment. 
                              Therefore, we eventually <b>presented the message in the detail view</b> instead, and planned to consider the edit feature in phase two.

                              The filter <b>keys and values were naturally dynamic</b>. They would change based on configuration. It was possible that a filter had been saved, but later some configurations changed, causing part of the filter keys and values 
                              to no longer exist. We needed to figure out a treatment for this situation and convey it to users. My initial idea was to either automatically remove the non-existent filter keys and values, and inform 
                              users that those values were no longer available, or disable the entire filter set and notify users that the filters could not be applied by displaying messages in the filter list view. Because the proposal 
                              could not work due to API call constraints, I ideated other solutions, such as in both the result page and each filter detail view, indicating which exact values were missing. I later realized it was not 
                              possible to identify exactly which part was missing without making an additional API call, which would negatively impact system performance.

                              Next, I explored the idea of giving users two options: applying the original ones and showing the corresponding results, or applying and omitting the missing values in the filter set. I learned from the 
                              development team that in the result page, the missing values would be presented, but they were not applied. We were unable to automatically remove the display of missing values from the result page. 
                              Eventually, we <b>utilized a disclaimer</b> as a workaround to address API limitations.

                            In some situations, the system could not present the updated view, so users might accidentally apply a deleted saved filter. (E.g., When a saved filter got removed from UserA side, but UserB has the 
                            saved filter detail view open and has not refreshed to get the updated list yet, it is possible that UserB "apply" or "copy the URL" of a deleted saved filter.) I <b>listed down all the scenarios we 
                            needed to address first</b>, and started to ideate potential solutions. My initial thought was showing some error messages when users applied a deleted saved filter, and automatically refreshing the page 
                            for them. After syncing up with developers, I realized that the system did not know the filter had been deleted when it was applied. It required an extra API call to check it, which would lead to a 
                            legacy issue.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Then we collaboratively proposed a new solution: <b>making an API call after a filter is applied</b> to check whether the associated saved filter still exists. If it has been deleted, we would display a message 
                            prompting users to refresh the page to get the most up-to-date view. If users chooses not to refresh, but modifies some filter values and attempts to save, the “Update Saved Filters” button would be hidden, 
                            while the option to “Save As” a new filter would remain available. Building on the feasible idea, we refined and iterated it, eventually arriving at an alternative version that could be more intuitive and 
                            user-friendly: If users are only viewing the page and <b>make no changes, no reaction or message needs to be shown</b>. If users <b>make edits and attempt to update the filter, we display a message informing them that 
                            the saved filter no longer exists and suggest using “Save As” to proceed</b>. If users <b>access a page via a URL tied to a deleted saved filter, we still present the filtered view, treating the filters as newly added</b>. 
                            We would also show a message to inform users, and they have the option to save the filters as a new one.

                    <p>
                        To ensure a smooth implementation of the design, I finalized the interaction flow to clearly <b>outline the end-to-end user journey for developers</b>. I prepared a comprehensive Figma file with <b>detailed 
                        documentation to support the implementation handoff</b>. Additionally, I collaborated with the DS team to <b>file tickets for new patterns</b>, and maintained ongoing communication with the DS team, developers, 
                        and PMs to <b>address edge cases</b> throughout the process.
                      </p>    
    
                      <p>
                        At the time, our team was experimenting with a new hand-off method – documenting all design details directly within the Figma file, alongside mockups and user flows, instead of uploading images and writing 
                        notes in GitLab tickets. The goal was to <b>streamline communication and collaboration between the design and development teams</b>. As the first project to adopt this approach, my hand-off file was recognized as 
                        <b>a strong example and was included in our design operations guide</b> for other designers to learn from and follow. 
                      </p> 

                      <p>
                        Following this project, I also supported the <b>design and implementation of similar functionalities across three additional workspaces</b> within F5XC. Once the refined version of the feature was in development, 
                        I re-engaged with the Bot Defense PM and development team to ensure new change requests were properly ticketed and previous designs were updated to <b>maintain consistent logic and visual coherence across the platform</b>.

                <h6 class="f5xc_color">Enhance efficiency of resolution validation and set up model for team collaboration.</h6>

                <p>
                  The new feature allows customers to easily reapply previously used filters and <b>efficiently collaborate with team members and the F5 Managed Services team</b> on resolution validation.
                </p>    


                <p>
                  Through this project, my cross-functional team and I <b>established a collaboration model that enabled close partnership with the DS team</b>. I was able to leverage their expertise, gather valuable input, 
                  and <b>approach challenges from a system-level perspective</b>. This model is adaptable and can be reused by other team members for future projects.
                </p>    


                <p>
                  I also <b>shared this experience with other F5 designers</b> through our designer all-hands and 1:1 conversations, highlighting the challenges I faced, the strategies I used to foster cross-functional collaboration, 
                  and the approaches I took to overcome constraints and deliver an improved user experience.
                </p>  


                <p>
                  I later had the opportunity to <b>support additional workspaces</b> (e.g., WAAP, MCAC, DA, etc.) in developing their filter reusability functionality. During this process, I refined and enhanced the feature, 
                  and re-engaged with the Bot Defense PM and development team to support ongoing collaboration and feature updates.
