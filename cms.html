                      Concept management system aims to support efficient and engaging concept submission and tracking. The Innovation Design Team at American Family Insurance is a venture building studio that adopts design thinking and lean methodologies to support innovative business development. The team was in an experimental stage and did not have an efficient way to manage hundreds of generated concepts and ongoing ventures. Therefore, I designed this new platform aligning with the continuous changing development process to serve the team members.

                <p>
                    In the beginning, I cooperated with another design intern to collect user feedback on the currenct development process, 
                    the pain points of using existing tools, and expectations toward an ideal concept management tool. We conducted internal 
                    crowdsourcing by placing a set of posters on the office wall for people to post their thoughts, and interviewed 6 team 
                    members specializing in business, technology, and design. I was later given ownership of this project and analyzed the 
                    research data to support the next step design work.

                        I found that the Innovation Design Team has its own development process which involved two main sections - the Top of the 
                        Funnel (TOF) and the Funnel. In the TOF process, we developed concepts in some focus areas which belonged to particular 
                        adjacencies defined by the team, and used methods such as concept pitch combining with scorecards and leadership team 
                        meetings to evaluate concepts. If a concept moved on to be a venture, it would go into the Funnel process. Ultimately, 
                        a venture would be launched and become a new business or a new product. The visualization below shows a brief summary of our TOF 
                        development process.

                <p>
                    With users’ expectations in mind, I started researching on some existing resources to find out if there’s 
                    anything we could use or ideas we could borrow from. 10 of the most popular idea management tools were 
                    evaluated from design, technology, and business perspectives. From the design stand point, 
                    concept submission, tracking, and report were emphasized. I found that none of these systems could 
                    sufficiently fulfill our requirements, while remaining in our price-point.

                              concept would be designed, and a digital scorecard for a set of criteria was developed for people to evaluate concepts.

                              email, provide notifications, and allow editing items simultaneously.

                    With the above values in mind, I started the design work. My first step was creating a system diagram to help 
                    clarify how the system could work as a whole picture. While doing the diagram, I also developed high-level design concepts
                    for the main features of the system, such as submission form, notification, comment, scoreboard, search, browse, 
                    and report features.

                    Based on the design concepts, I created wireframes to visualize the features and present the information 
                    architecture of the system. I focused on the key features for TOF in the very beginning, trying to make the 
                    system align with the development process and serve both online and offline collaborations. Below are the most 
                    important two pages of the system – the homepage and the analysis page.

                <p>
                    On the homepage, team members can submit concepts, give feedback, track status, and export information through a dashboard.

                    To ensure that my design could eventually meet the needs of various stakeholders, and that I could make changes 
                    in the right direction, I took the first-version wireframes as boundary objects and interviewed different 
                    roles of the team to see what was unclear or missing. Afer discussing with my mentor, we decided to focus on 
                    the design of the hompage dashboard and the information visualization report in this early stage. I also defined 
                    the schema for the database along the way. The following are the the most important changes I made based on the 
                    team members' feedback:
