                    <p>
                            Microsoft Academic is a knowledge graph which supports academic influence evaluation with a free public web 
                            search engine for academic publications. The front-end website also serves as a place to present and promote the 
                            knowledge graph. Among six entities on the website, "conference" was the main focus in this design challenge. 
                            I redesigned the conference entity detail page (taking KDD as an example) by creating reasonable information architecture, 
                            providing a "multi-sense” similar conference feature, and enriching the web page with multiple information visualizations 
                            to support an intuitive and engaging user experience.

 <!-- User Need Assumptions -->

                      <h3>User Need Assumptions</h3>
                    <p>
                        The project goal was to fix current design issues, and design a “multi-sense” similar conference feature and multiple 
                        data visualizations to support an efficient conceptualization of the trend behind the analyzed data. In the beginning, I explored 
                        the website focusing on KDD entity detail page (EDP) and conference entity type analytics page (ETAP). With limited time and resources, 
                        I chose to skip user studies but made some assumptions about user needs and behaviors to support the design work. 
                        These assumptions could be tested and verified in the future stage:
                    </p>

                          <td><p><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></p></td>
                          <td><p>Users would like to know the top influential entities and might want to explore more.</p></td>

                    <p>
                       With the design decisions made, my next step was brainstorming potential design solutions. I sketched down ideas, 
                       and made some decisions regarding overall visual style, theme colors, typeface, font size, etc. before starting the 
                       hi-fi design work.

                    <p>
                       I tried to engage users and create an energetic, modern, and up-to-date impression by designing an interface with a 
                       cleaner, brighter, and softer style. I chose blue as the theme color to align with the logo mark and bring a trustworthy, 
                       authoritative feeling. Legibility, color blindness issues, and overall color harmony were also taken care of while picking 
                       secondary and tertiary colors for visualizations. WCAG AA standard was followed and the complementary colors with same values 
                       were avoided to use in the same diagrams. 
                    </p>    
         
                    <p>
                      Besides, typefaces with legibility and more neutral style were used – Open Sans and Helvetica Neue. To create a clear visual 
                      hierarchy and enhance readability, I set three headings and made paragraph text above 16pt. 
                    </p>

                                    In the first version, I tried to group basic info by placing elements closely, horizontally. However, while 
                                    scrolling down the page, if we want to fix the filter part to make it align with the right-side visualizations, 
                                    the header part would be cut into two. If we choose to fix the header, it would occupy too much space. Therefore, 
                                    to avoid conflicts, I redesigned the basic info section by grouping the elements on the left side. It could be 
                                    fixed along with the filter section while page scrolling. For visualizations, I also changed infinite scroll into 
                                    tabs to shorten the webpage and reduce information overload. To make the style more consistent, I later used a card 
                                    to group basic info and moved the action buttons to a more obvious place.

                                        For the time/duration selection of the visualizations, I designed two drop-down menus in the beginning. 
                                        However, this type of interaction requires twice selections, and it would become more while comparing data 
                                        in one duration with another. Therefore, I refined the design to make it more convenient. Users can select 
                                        a start year and an end year right on the same drop-down menu. Besides, I also added the vertical guidance 
                                        behind visualizations to enhance readability and help users quickly know the corresponding value on the x-axis.

                                        The “multi-sense” similar conference feature was first designed as recommendation lists, placing at the bottom of the page. 
                                        Later, I took mobile usage into consideration and tried to make them more visually comfortable, so a three-column version was 
                                        generated. However, the feature still looked plain. I thought visualizations could enhance engagement, so the third version with 
                                        three visualizations for co-citation, co-authorship, and co-concept top 3 venues was designed. The order of these three could be 
                                        based on the importance/popularity of the information. Besides, I also refined the titles for each section to make them more 
                                        precise and concise.

                                    “MA Rank” and “MA Rank Normalized by Publications.” However, users may not familiar with the concept of “normalization.” 
                                    Therefore, I tried to figure out an easier way for them to understand the concept by changing the x-axis label into

                     <p>
                        Through three rounds of iteration, the final design is presented below. In KDD EDP new design, the top part was a 
                        fixed global navigation bar with Microsoft Academic logo, search bar, citation list, and sign up / sign in button. 
                        Below the navigation bar, users would see the name of the conference and basic into at the first sight, accompanying 
                        with key dates, conference proceedings and action buttons listed beside. On the bottom-left side was the filter 
                        section where users could narrow down the topics for visualizations. The default view for the visualization section 
                        was "Citation". Users could shift between “Author,” “Institution,” and “Related” venues through the tabs.

                                    There were three visualizations on "Citation" tab. First of all, a line chart was used to replace the original bar 
                                    chart for publications and citations over time to better present the variation. Secondly, both incoming and outgoing 
                                    citations were integrated on the same visualization, with ideas borrowed from Sankey diagram to present both flow amount 
                                    and direction at the same time. Thirdly, citation evolution could be seen through a comparison of both time points and durations. 
                                    Top five were set as default (based on the most recent time period selected), but users could hide them or search and add more. 
                                    A maximum amount could be set up with a warning message provided when the limitation was reached.

                                    On the author tab, there were two visualizations. Firstly, a bubble chart combining with a two-dimensional space was used to 
                                    present three-dimensional datasets for top authors in Microsoft Academic Rank (MA Rank). Exact numbers of publications and 
                                    citations were presented on hover pop-up for potential user needs. Besides, an info icon was placed beside the title to 
                                    explain “MA Rank” for users. A small pop-up with a brief explanation could be shown on hover. The second one was a line chart 
                                    for citation evolution of authors. Top three were set as default, but users could hide them or search and add more. A maximum 
                                    amount could be set up with a warning message provided when the limitation was reached.

                                    to reduce information overload and help users easily focus on the top entities, but more institutions could be added on if needed. 
                                    The second one was a world map to show the headquarter locations of institutions, with a hover pop-up for institution address for user 
                                    reference. A closer view was set as default.

                                    There might be another option of using dots with ranking as x-axis and similarity as y-axis to integrate three charts into one.
