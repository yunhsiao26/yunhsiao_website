                    <p>
                        Microsoft Academic is a knowledge graph which supports <b>academic influence evaluation</b> and academic publication access <b>for academic institutions and researchers</b> (more than one million/month). There are six entity types in 
                        this knowledge graph – publication, author, topic, conference, journal, and institution. Each of them has a corresponding <b>Entity Type Analytic Page (ETAP) with topic filters and data visualizations 
                        to present its development trend</b>. In this project, I focused on redesigning the topic filter feature to solve usability and readability issues. By allowing both topic browse and search, presenting 
                        topic hierarchy, and applying different visual treatments, I aimed to help users <b>quickly understand the knowledge graph and smoothly operate the feature to easily access the trend analysis summary in 
                        their interested topics (aka field of studies)</b>.

                <p>
                  In the very beginning of the project, I tried to clarify the serving purposes of the topic browser feature. It is for users to <b>filter their interested field of studies to see the trend analysis</b> 
                  (mainly in data visualization format) in Entity Type Analytic Pages (ETAPs). (The picture beside is the previous version of Topic ETAP as an example.) Through a kickoff meeting, I had a better 
                  understanding of how this feature worked and the direction for improvement. I also noticed some readability issues by evaluating the website, so I proposed a plan 
                  to fix them together with this project. Below are the key issues and action items:
                </p> 
  
                <table class="a">
                    <tr>
                      <td class="column01"><p><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></p></td>
                      <td class="column02"><p>Allowing only browsing and filtering topics shown on the current layer were insufficient, so we planned to <b>support a searching experience</b> for users to easier access their desired topics.</p></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td><p><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></p></td>
                      <td><p>Unclear about topic relationships was a pain point, so we wanted to <b>present the topic hierarchy to show topic relationships</b> for users to easily understand in this feature.</p></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><p><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></p></td>
                        <td><p>The smaller topics were hard to read and easy to be ignored in the tag cloud (the font size of text representing the number of publications), and when there were so many topics in one layer, it was overwhelming. We could <b>apply other visual treatments on topic "tags" to enhance readability and reduce information overload</b>.</p></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><p><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></p></td>
                        <td><p>Some functional colors were undefined or misdefined, and the color contrast of some color combinations were not enough, so <b>redefining colors for different action statuses (e.g., hover, selected, inactive, etc.) and data visualizations</b> to solve cognition issues was an urgent need.</p></td>
                    </tr>

                <p>
                  By reviewing previous user studies, I learned that the target user groups of Microsoft Academic website were <b>researchers across various career stages and fields</b>. 
                  They could be students who just joined the academic community <b>without a clear idea about what to focus on</b>, and were eager to explore and learn more. They could be 
                  established researchers who were overwhelmed by their works and wanted to have <b>a quick view of the development trend of particular topics they cared about, as well as their related topics</b>. 
                </p>

          Therefore, this feature could serve as not only a filter, but also <b>a quick view of different topics and their relationships for users to easier understand the academic field, and build a mental map of thier field of studies</b>.

         <p>
          Besides, I also clarified the user flow of the website <b>to know how users used our service and how we served users as a whole</b>. Starting from the homepage, users could browse through highlighted resources, use keyword search, or explore 
          Entitiy Type Analytic Pages (ETAPs). The topic filters on the ETAPs were what we focused on in this project.

              <p>
                 Based on the above design requirements, I tried to clarify questions regarding the topic hierarchy structure with my manager. I realized that it was <b>a complex DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) 
                 instead of a tree</b>. There were 700,000 topics in the knowledge graph, and they were organized into a six-layer hierarchy. For each layer, we showed at most 200 top topics according to the API.

                  At that time, there were two types of unaccessible topics, including orphan topics without an ancestor and descendant, and those topics not in the list of the top 200 in each layer. 
                  For the first issue, the data team has been putting effort to fix it. As for the second one, we were hoping to solve it through a search feature in the new design.

                        With the decisions in mind, my next steps were <b>exploring possible solutions for new colors, thinking about different use cases for the filter feature, and sketching down interaction ideas with 
                        reasonable user flow</b>. Meanwhile, I had frequent discussion sessions and design review meetings with my managers and engineer teammates to keep them on the same page and collect feedback instantly.

                       I tried to fix the above issues through several rounds of iteration, and eventually, figured out new color sets with which our team reached a consensus. 
                       The new color design guideline is shown below, in which hover, line, and background colors were redefined, colors for data visualizations were adjusted, 
                       and new colors for different functionalities were added on.

                       Overall, <b>color contrast, color blindness, and color harmony</b> were taken care of. I tended to <b>pick colors with lower values to create a comfortable reading experience</b> for users. 
                       By making these changes, I also tried to <b>add a more energetic, modern, and up-to-date vibe</b> to the website.

                      In the following stage, I created hi-fi wireframes for design review and iteration. By breaking down the project into "browse" and "search" two sections, I was able to iterate them one by one.

                        In the browse part, I ran through four rounds of iteration to ensure intuitive interactions:

                                    In the beginning, I changed the style of topic tags from tag cloud to buttons to make them <b>aligned with other pages and solve the readability issue</b>. The order of topics was kept, numbers were added on, and a color gradient 
                                    was applied to present the idea of having more to less publications. To avoid information overload, I also presented only the top five topics as default, but allow users to expand and view all. 
                                    Besides, a hover pop-up was designed for users to view and explore the next layer. When it came to the last layer, there was no child topic, so other related topics were placed on the page for users to explore more.

                                    Through discussions with PMs and engineers, I found that <b>users may want to see other ancestor topics of a topic</b>, so the first version design was not sufficient. Besides, 
                                    <b>the hover pop-up to show topics in the next layer would require the second API call, and it might take longer to load</b>, so this design was not preferred. Based on the feedback, 
                                    I removed the hover effect and designed two other "breadcrumbs" to present the topic hierarchy – hover or click to see other ancestors in the layers above.

                                    Later, I realized that the "breadcrumbs" in the second version would take longer to load, so I tried the third version where ellipsis was utilized for the layers above the parent topic layer. 
                                    In this way, the topics would only need to be loaded when users want to check out and click the dropdown menu. Although this design could work, it required changes on API and was hard to implement. 
                                    Therefore, the team decided not to take it at that time.

                                    My fourth round iteration was also the final round for the browse design. In this version, a way of easily presenting topic hierarchy <b>without extra API calls or loading issues</b> was figured out. 
                                    We presented the hierarchy right on the page of each layer. In addition to the currently selected topic, one layer above (the parent topics) and one layer below (the child topics) were shown on 
                                    the page. Based on this logic, we decided not to show other related topics in the last layer. I also kept the "breadcrumbs" as what it was, <b>applied alphabetical order to topics, presented the first 
                                    10 topics as default for each layer, and expand all for the first layer to make it convenient for users</b>.

                       For the search part, I went through three rounds of iteration to ensure a smooth user flow:

                                    In the first version, I designed <b>search suggestions with differentiators for users to select topics with multiple meanings</b>. Users could expand a topic to see its 
                                    family DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). Based on what I learned from PMs, <b>the maximum amount of parent topics in the extreme cases was three</b>. Therefore, I made 
                                    <b>demos for the edge cases</b>. I thought about two ways to show the hierarchy graph. One was presenting each family graph individually, while the other was merging 
                                    all in one and allowing users to swipe and see the whole picture.

                                    By talking with PMs, I later realized that showing the whole family DAG might not work because the structure could be very complex, such as <b>each parent topic might have multiple parent topics, 
                                    and we did not have a large space for it</b>. As for showing family DAG individually, many topics might be duplicated, which was not ideal either. Therefore, I considered showing only one layer above 
                                    for user reference. This design could work, but it would take time and effort to change API and was "nice to have" after all. Thus, we reached a consensus to push it to a future stage.

                                    Eventually, we picked the third version design. Here, we moved the differentiators from search suggestions to a transition page to <b>solve a potential loading issue</b>. Users would see regular 
                                    terms without differentiators in search suggestions. When they click a term, if it has multiple meanings, the transition page would show up with differentiators for users to select. 
                                    <b>To smoother user experience, we borrowed the loading animation from the website and placed it for the loading status</b> (before the transition page showing up). A rule for the situation when 
                                    input terms did not match any topics in the graph was also designed. <b>The result would be reflected right in the search suggestion area to save user time</b>. Besides, I figured out a way to <b>support navigation 
                                    through "breadcrumbs" in search scenarios</b> by presenting the topics starting from the topic selected from the search result to the latest selected topic. For the layers that users did not 
                                    go through between the first layer and the first selected topic, ellipsis was applied.

                                    Bringing in engineers and other team members in an early design stage is beneficial in multiple aspects, such as clarifying technology limitations so that designers can conduct projects accordingly, 
                                    realistically, and effectively. It is also easier for them to buy in the design in later stages since they have participated in and better understood the project.
