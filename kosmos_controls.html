                      <h3>Project Vision</h3>
                    <p>
                       KOSMOS is a <b>point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) service combining AI technologies to facilitate ultrasound scans and disease diagnosis</b>, especially for <b>emergency cases, telemedicine, and medical educational 
                       purposes</b>. With new scan modes and features developed, the original control design encountered its restriction to present functionalities and serve users efficiently. Besides, for both control panels and 
                       scales for depth, PRF (Pulse Repetition Frequency), and sweep speed controls, there were existing usability and readability issues to be solved. Therefore, the team decided to redesign all the scales and control panels to enhance 
                       scan operation experiences. I took ownership of the project, developed <b>new rules for scale presentation with new visual treatments</b>, and designed <b>a scalable layout with transient sliders for control 
                       panels which could be applied across all scan modes</b>.

                    <p>
                       In KOSMOS bridge (the device), there were two main scan types – free flow, and protocol-driven flow. <b>The free flow was a more basic type focusing on the heart, lungs, and abdomen, in which B, M, and C modes 
                       were provided, with PW and CW new modes added on</b>. These modes were what we mainly focused on in this project (and later applied the same new design to the protocol-driven flow). Each mode had its own scan 
                       views (aka imaging views), generally with <b>control panel and imaging window</b> two parts (as shown in pictures beside).
                    </p>    

                    <p>
                        Through kickoff meetings with PMs and other designers, I realized that current critical usability issues for sonographers were:

                        <tr>

                    I also clarified the expectations for the new design at the very beginning of the project:
                  </p>    
        
  
                  <table class="a">
                      <tr>
                        <td class="column01"><p><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></p></td>
                        <td class="column02"><p>A new layout for control panels and interactions for controls were required. <b>Transient sliders could be a potential solution</b> for depth, gain, TGC (Time Gain Compensation – for image brightness and contrast), and PRF (Pulse Repetition Frequency – for velocity in PW/CW) controls.</p></td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td><p><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></p></td>
                        <td><p>As PW/CW developed, new <b>intuitive mode shifting (accessing) and control switching features</b> were required.</p></td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                          <td><p><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></p></td>
                          <td><p>The depth scale should be able to <b>serve users in efficiently knowing the physical location (the distance from the “skin line”) and the size of the field of view (FOV)</b> (the two-dimensional region the anatomy shown in the image), and in <b>making informal/approximate measurements</b>. (Both time scale and velocity scale were also serving as references.)
                            </p></td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                          <td><p><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></p></td>
                          <td><p>The new design was expected to be released with PW and CW new features in May 2020.</p></td>
                      </tr>
                    </table>    


                    <p>
                        This project covered three main tasks – <b>scale redesign, control redesign, and control panel redesign</b>. To conduct the project efficiently, I followed this order and 
                        <b>broke the tasks into separate actionable items</b> together with PMs.
                    </p>    


                    <p>
                        Besides, the user flow of free flow and the functionalities of each mode, including the controls and mode access, were clarified with other designers' help. Starting from B mode, users were able to 
                        access all the other modes. In each mode, there were different accessible modes for users to choose. They could go back and forth to shift between different modes.
                    </p>

                        I also tried to clarify all the imaging window sizes (heights) to be covered. There were eight layouts with 5 types of imaging window sizes. They could be roughly categorized into three groups – larger (1080, 945, 810 px), medium (720, 540 px), and smaller (360, 300 px) groups.

                     I started the project with scale redesign, focusing on the depth scale first. Through reviewing other POCUS products in the market, I found that most of them had <b>both major and minor tick marks, 
                     and not only threads but also dots could be used</b>. Besides, <b>showing numbers and the unit</b> beside tick marks were helpful, and <b>setting breakpoints</b> for different ranges could help 
                     <b>to present more scale details when the range is small and fewer details when the range is large</b>.

                        There were three types of scales in KOSMOS. The <b>depth scale</b> was primarily for sonographers <b>to know the physical location and the size of the field of view (FOV) and assistance in making approximate measurements</b>. 
                        The <b>velocity scale was to present PRF in PW/CW</b>. The <b>time scale</b> was for presenting both <b>sweep speed in M mode and also ECG and DA trace</b>. Below were key changes made during the iteration stage for scales.

                                    Regarding depth scale visual design, to create a clear visual hierarchy, I used <b>longer and thicker threads plus emphasized numbers for major tick marks, shorter threads for secondary tick marks, and dots for minor 
                                    tick marks</b>. To let the scale easier to read but occupy less space, I made all tick marks <b>thicker and shorter</b> along the way, and <b>picked colors that were not too dim or too bright</b> for the regular and zoom in status 
                                    (#DDDDDD and # F2B95B). As for numbers on major tick marks, by <b>increasing font weight and changing the typeface from Roboto (the predefined one across the device) to Helvetica Neue</b>, the readability was enhanced. 
                                    We wanted to show both start and end numbers on the scale (with its original tick marks), so I <b>saved a certain space (16 px distance) between the first/last tick mark to the top/bottom imaging area border for 
                                    presenting the start/end number</b>. In some cases, while users zoom in or move the imaging area, the first/last emphasized number on major tick marks would be too close to the start/end number, so I also tried to 
                                    <b>define a range (28 px) in which the start/end number would be hidden and only the first/last emphasized number would be shown</b>.

                                    The rules for depth scale were also iterated for three times. In the beginning, which tick marks to present in which views was defined based on depth range and zoom in status with different imaging window sizes. In a design review meeting, 
                                    I realized that <b>the minimum range was 1 cm (depth 4 cm, zoom in to 400%), and the maximum range was 30 cm (depth 30 cm, regular 100% view). By defining how many major tick marks we wanted to show in a range could make tick marks presented 
                                    more evenly in different ranges, and also help us systematically define the breakpoints</b>. Therefore, in the second iteration, with other designers’ help, I defined five breakpoints for the major tick marks in the full image view, and combined 
                                    the rules for secondary and major tick marks in the first version to create new rules for all the window sizes. This time, one more window size in the new PW/CW mode was involved. This version looked good, but we later found that in smaller 
                                    views, when there were only major tick marks, it looked not ideal, and those for medium views could be redesigned as well. Thus, in the third version, I <b>defined breakpoint rules for larger, medium, and smaller views separately</b>. We got 5-7 major 
                                    tick marks for the larger view (1080, 945, 810 px), 5-6 for the medium view (720, 540 px), and 4-5 for the smaller view (360, 300 px). Eventually, I <b>made minor tick marks in the views without secondary tick marks to be secondary to make the scales 
                                    consistent with velocity scales in PW/CW</b>.

                 <p>
                    After wrapping up the scale design, my next task was the control design. Since we already knew that <b>transient sliders could be a direction to put effort on, and some products in the market also applied it and 
                    worked well too</b>, I started the design work with this idea. <b>Developers were also involved in an early stage to ensure design feasibility</b>.

                                For the depth control, in the beginning, two versions were ideated. One was a slider with an oval button to select the desired value, the other was a wheel for users to scroll and pick a value. 
                                Since <b>the value options for the depth were predefined/selected numbers instead of natural continuous values</b>, we decided to pick <b>the wheel one which was more suitable for a “discrete slider.”</b> 
                                In the following iteration, I switched the plus(“+”) and minus(“–”) buttons to make the slider easier to conceptualize, <b>enlarged the font size and the space between numbers along the way to 
                                enhance readability and support smoother operation</b>, and tried different colors that had color harmony with theme colors to make the wheel more popping up from the background image. Eventually, <b>a brighter and softer color was picked 
                                with a translucent background for users to view it with clearness and comfort</b>. Based on team member’s suggestion, I also <b>removed the plus and minus buttons, so that users would not expect to 
                                see continuous values in the following numbers</b>. In this stage, we also discussed <b>two potential ways to trigger the control wheel – by tapping a button on the control panel or tapping the depth scale itself</b>.
                                Since the traits of velocity control for PRF in PW/CW was very similar to depth control, so we applied the same design to it.

                                For the gain control, I also went through the same iteration as for the depth control, but it was more complex with another brightness and contrast control – TGC, required to be taken care of with gain control together. <b>TGC had two 
                                controls – near gain and far gain</b>. They allowed users to <b>adjust the brightness and contrast of the top and bottom parts of an image separately</b>. <b>The gain value would be the average of the total near gain and far gain values</b>. 
                                Based on these, I figured out two ways to trigger it. One was having a control button on the control panel, the other was showing the button only when gain control was triggered. The first one was later picked for 
                                it was more intuitive and convenient for users. Also, since <b>brightness values were continuous from 0% to 100%, the slider design was eventually selected for both gain and TGC</b>.

                                At this point, the touch-sensitive area for transient sliders was also discussed. At first, I proposed to place the depth wheel at around one-third of the imaging area, and allow users to <b>scroll on both left-hand and right-hand side of the wheel to take care 
                                of both left-handedness and tight-handedness</b>. However, the team had the concern that the wheel would block too much part of the imaging area, so later decided to place it closer to the imaging area border instead, and applied the same behavior to the gain and 
                                TGC slider. After collecting feedback from users, we realized that <b>supporting scrolling on the depth button (the control trigger) itself would make the control easier for users since they normally had only one hand for operation</b> (the other hand was used for 
                                holding the probe). Therefore, we <b>enlarged the touch-sensitive area by allowing users to scroll vertically on the whole control panel after pressing the depth button and before the wheel dismissed</b>. This design was also applied to gain control that users could 
                                directly scroll on the gain button horizontally in the control panel area. Besides, I also proposed two ways to dismiss transient sliders – auto dismiss and by <b>tapping anywhere in the imaging area</b>. After discussing with the team, we together defined the <b>auto dismiss 
                                after user finger released for two seconds</b>, and added one more rule of <b>tapping any other control buttons to dismiss</b>.

                                With the concern that users may need some explanations to better understand each control, the design team decided to use a pop-up to tackle this issue. While users tapping on a button, <b>a pop up would show up with several options (3-4) and 
                                the corresponding brief explanations</b> for users to choose. In the end of this project, I also helped with the pop up design. We finally picked a set of designs that were able to <b>present all the options clearly and better contain longer strings

                        through Zeplin and Google Drive</b>. During implementation, we had meetings and discussions frequently. I also helped with <b>testing the new design through multiple APKs</b>, and provided 
                        feedback for developers to <b>refine the implementation to get closer to the actual design</b>. We got positive feedback on the new interaction design from sonographers and cardiologists. 
                        The final design with prototypes were presented as below:

                    pick these ideas with big changes to polish and move on due to time limitation and scope consideration, but they could be future references when we come back to refine the control panels again.

                                    Talking with developers in an early stage is a good strategy for not only ensuring feasibility, but also guaranteeing release of implementation in time.
