                      <h3>Project Vision</h3>
                    <p>
                       KOSMOS is a <b>point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) service combining AI technologies to facilitate ultrasound scans and disease diagnosis</b> (non-invasive diagnostic test), especially for <b>emergency cases, telemedicine, and medical educational 
                       purposes</b>. With new scan modes and features developed, the original control design encountered its restriction to present functionalities and serve users efficiently. Besides, for both control panels and 
                       scales for depth, PRF (Pulse Repetition Frequency), and sweep speed controls, there were existing usability and readability issues to be solved. Therefore, the team decided to redesign all the scales and control panels to enhance 
                       scan operation experiences. I took ownership of the project, developed <b>new rules for scale presentation with new visual treatments</b>, and designed <b>a scalable layout with transient sliders for control 
                       panels which could be applied across all scan modes</b>.

                    <p>
                       In KOSMOS, there were two main scan types – free flow, and protocol-driven flow. <b>The free flow was a more basic type focusing on the heart, lungs, and abdomen, in which B, M, and C modes 
                       were provided, with PW and CW new modes added on</b>. B mode was the most basic mode in which the amplitude of the returned echoes was used to create images. While in Doppler modes (PW & CW), the change or shift in frequency of the 
                       returned echoes were used to detect and quantify blood flow velocity, direction, and flow patterns. The above modes were what we mainly focused on in this project (and later the similar new design was applied to the protocol-driven flow). 
                       Each mode had its own scan views (aka imaging views), generally with <b>control panel and imaging window</b> two parts (as shown in the picture below).

                        This project could be broken down into three main parts – <b>scale redesign, control redesign, and control panel redesign</b>. To conduct the project efficiently, I followed this order and

                        Also, there were <b>different accessible modes for users to choose</b>. They could go back and forth to shift between different modes.

                     <p>
                        With a better understanding of the project scope and the product, I started to understand the target users and their needs through <b>reviewing previous user research documentations and 
                        talking with designers and the PM</b>.

                     <p>
                        At that time, we had <b>two target user groups – cardiologists, and medical students</b>, and two secondary user groups – EMT (Emergency Medical Technicians), and rural physicians, which were our 
                        future market opportunities. For the target users, their goals were more <b>education and research-oriented</b>. Therefore, <b>a portable, easy-to-operate device with guidance to teach them how to scan</b> was critical. 
                     </p>

                Besides, I learned that there were four usage modes – handheld, tablet on a surface, tablet on a mount, and tablet on a cart. Among these, <b>handheld and tablet on a surface</b> were the most common 
                ones for our target users, so the scenarios of <b>one-hand usage and reading from a certain distance</b> had to be taken care of.
              </p>    


              <p>
                In addition to user types, I also clarified user workflows. For cardiologists and students, they scanned for education/studies, and exercises/assignments. Their workflow usually started with ultrasound scanning. 
                They would save images and clips, and add annotations and measurements. After completing scanning, they might do some data management works (such as filtering, tagging, deleting, etc.) and could export the 
                data to a USB drive or to the MedEd online platform, which was an educational cloud service for exam review and management (for both operators and reviewers) provided by EchoNous.
             </p>    


             <p>
                As for medical usage, creating patient and exam profiles were required. Users might do it before or after scanning, depending on how emergent the case was, and they could do it manually or import patient data 
                from EHR (Electronic Health Record) systems. They would save images and clips, and add notes later or instantly. Eventually, they would review/edit/fill in patient info and exam info before archiving the data 
                to PACS (Picture archiving and communication systems).

        From the above, we could know that <b>a live imaging view was an entry point of ultrasound scanning exams</b>, and its core functionalities were to serve users to <b>easily find the views and acquire images and clips they need</b>.

                        With the above understanding, I moved forward to the design stage. My first task was scale redesign, focusing on the depth scale first. Through reviewing other POCUS products in the market, 
                        I found that most of them had <b>both major and minor tick marks, and not only threads but also dots could be used</b>. Besides, <b>showing numbers and the unit</b> beside tick marks were helpful, 
                        and <b>setting breakpoints</b> for different ranges could help <b>to present more scale details in a smaller range and fewer details in a larger range</b>.

                        There were three types of scales in KOSMOS. The <b>depth scale</b> was primarily for sonographers <b>to know the physical location and the size of the field of view (FOV) and assistance in making approximate measurements</b>. 
                        The <b>velocity scale was to present PRF in PW/CW</b>. The <b>time scale</b> was for presenting both <b>sweep speed in M mode and also ECG and DA trace</b>. Below were key changes made during the iteration stage for scales.

                                    Regarding depth scale visual design, to create a clear visual hierarchy, I used <b>longer and thicker threads plus emphasized numbers for major tick marks, shorter threads for secondary tick marks, and dots for minor 
                                    tick marks</b>. To let the scale easier to read but occupy less space, I made all tick marks <b>thicker and shorter</b> along the way, and <b>picked colors that were not too dim or too bright</b> for the regular and zoom in status 
                                    (#DDDDDD and # F2B95B). As for numbers on major tick marks, by <b>increasing font weight and changing the typeface from Roboto (the predefined one across the device) to Helvetica Neue</b>, the readability was enhanced. 
                                    We wanted to show both start and end numbers on the scale (with its original tick marks), so I <b>saved a certain space (16 px distance) between the first/last tick mark to the top/bottom imaging area border for 
                                    presenting the start/end number</b>. In some cases, while users zoom in or move the imaging area, the first/last emphasized number on major tick marks would be too close to the start/end number, so I also
                                    <b>defined a range (28 px) in which the start/end number would be hidden and only the first/last emphasized number would be visible</b>.

                                    The rules for depth scale were also iterated for three times. In the beginning, which tick marks to present in which views was defined based on depth range and zoom in status with different imaging window sizes. In a design review meeting, 
                                    I realized that <b>the minimum range was 1 cm (depth 4 cm, zoom in to 400%), and the maximum range was 30 cm (depth 30 cm, regular 100% view). By defining how many major tick marks we wanted to show in a range could make tick marks presented 
                                    more evenly in different ranges, and also help us systematically define the breakpoints</b>. Therefore, in the second iteration, with other designers’ help, I defined five breakpoints for the major tick marks in the full image view, and combined 
                                    the rules for secondary and major tick marks in the first version to create new rules for all the window sizes. This time, one more window size in the new PW/CW mode was involved. This version looked good, but we later found that in smaller 
                                    views, when there were only major tick marks, it looked not ideal, and those for medium views could be redesigned as well. Thus, in the third version, I <b>defined breakpoint rules for larger, medium, and smaller views separately</b>. We got 5-7 major 
                                    tick marks for the larger view (1080, 945, 810 px), 5-6 for the medium view (720, 540 px), and 4-5 for the smaller view (360, 300 px). Eventually, I <b>made minor tick marks in the views without secondary tick marks to be secondary to make the scales 
                                    consistent with velocity scales in PW/CW</b>.

                    After wrapping up the scale design, my next task was the control design. Since we already knew that <b>transient sliders could be a direction to put effort on, and some products in the market also applied it and 
                    worked well too</b>, I started the design work with this idea. <b>Developers were also involved in an early stage to ensure design feasibility</b>.

                                For the depth control, in the beginning, two versions were ideated. One was a slider with an oval button to select the desired value, the other was a wheel for users to scroll and pick a value. 
                                Since <b>the value options for the depth were predefined/selected numbers instead of natural continuous values</b>, we decided to pick <b>the wheel one which was more suitable for a “discrete slider.”</b> 
                                In the following iteration, I switched the plus(“+”) and minus(“–”) buttons to make the slider easier to conceptualize, <b>enlarged the font size and the space between numbers along the way to 
                                enhance readability and support smoother operation</b>, and tried different colors that had color harmony with theme colors to make the wheel more popping up from the background image. Eventually, <b>a brighter and softer color was picked 
                                with a translucent background for users to view it with clearness and comfort</b>. Based on team member’s suggestion, I also <b>removed the plus and minus buttons, so that users would not expect to 
                                see continuous values in the following numbers</b>. In this stage, we also discussed <b>two potential ways to trigger the control wheel – by tapping a button on the control panel or tapping the depth scale itself</b>.
                                Since the traits of velocity control for PRF in PW/CW was very similar to depth control, so we applied the same design to it.

                                For the gain control, I also went through the same iteration as for the depth control, but it was more complex with another brightness and contrast control – TGC, required to be taken care of with gain control together. <b>TGC had two 
                                controls – near gain and far gain</b>. They allowed users to <b>adjust the brightness and contrast of the top and bottom parts of an image separately</b>. <b>The gain value would be the average of the total near gain and far gain values</b>. 
                                Based on these, I figured out two ways to trigger it. One was having a control button on the control panel, the other was showing the button only when gain control was triggered. The first one was later picked for 
                                it was more intuitive and convenient for users. Also, since <b>brightness values were continuous from 0% to 100%, the slider design was eventually selected for both gain and TGC</b>.

                                To create a layout that could be applied to all scan modes across KOSMOS, I borrowed the idea from the PW/CW ultrasound control panel new design and <b>tried rectangle buttons with icons, button labels, and statuses</b>. The team had 
                                a great favor on this idea, so we started iterating from here. We tried different ways to present control buttons for both mode shifting (accessing) and control switching. In the end, we figured out <b>a concise 
                                way to present buttons by combining icons and different statues into one</b>. Also, we removed the text for mode buttons since they were self-explanatory based on user feedback. Starting with B mode, I finally applied the design 
                                to all modes. <b>The button orders for each mode were also adjusted to align with the usage frequency and be more consistent across</b>. We also <b>enlarged the button label font size to serve user needs in looking at the screen 
                                from a certain distance</b>.

                                At this point, the touch-sensitive area for transient sliders was also discussed. At first, I proposed to place the depth wheel at around one-third of the imaging area, and allow users to <b>scroll on both left-hand and right-hand side of the wheel to take care 
                                of both left-handedness and tight-handedness</b>. However, the team had the concern that the wheel would block too much part of the imaging area, so later decided to place it closer to the imaging area border instead, and applied the same behavior to the gain and 
                                TGC slider. After collecting feedback from users, we realized that <b>supporting scrolling on the depth button (the control trigger) itself would make the control easier since users normally had only one hand for operation</b> (the other hand was used for 
                                holding the probe). Therefore, we <b>enlarged the touch-sensitive area by allowing users to scroll vertically on the whole control panel after pressing the depth button and before the wheel dismissed</b>. This design was also applied to gain control that users could 
                                directly scroll on the gain button horizontally in the control panel area. Besides, I also proposed two ways to dismiss transient sliders – auto dismiss and by <b>tapping anywhere in the imaging area</b>. After discussing with the team, we together defined the <b>auto dismiss 
                                after user finger released for two seconds</b>, and added one more rule of <b>tapping any other control buttons to dismiss</b>.

                                With the concern that users may need some explanations to better understand each control, the design team decided to use a pop-up to tackle this issue. While users tapping on a button, <b>a pop up would show up with several options (3-4) and 
                                the corresponding brief explanations</b> for users to choose. In the end of this project, I also helped with the pop up design. We finally picked a set of designs that were able to <b>present all the options clearly and better contain longer strings

                                    users could access B mode controls in C mode, and switch between C and B mode controls. In PW, there were two situations. Users could come from “B – PW”, or “B – C – PW.” In the former case, users were allowed to switch between 
                                    B mode controls and PW controls by tapping the freeze or live toggle in the B mode window on top. In the later case, users were able to switch between PW and C or B mode controls by the same toggle. While in B/C live, there were 
                                    tabs on the control panel sidebar for users to switch between C and B mode controls. CW shared the same cases with PW.

                    After this project, I had opportunities to explore different layouts and visual treatments of control panels in live imaging views and cine review, trying to see if there were other ways to <b>make the views look 
                    cleaner</b>. Potential solutions could be <b>hiding the mode shifting buttons in the second layer</b>, and changing the background of the control panel to <b>enhance the sense of unity</b>. At that time, we did not 
                    pick these ideas with big changes to polish and move on due to time limitation and scope consideration, but they could be future references when we come back to refine the control panels again.
