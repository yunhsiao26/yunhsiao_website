                    <p>
                        KOSMOS is a <b>point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) service combining AI technologies to facilitate ultrasound scans and disease diagnosis</b>, especially for emergency cases, telemedicine, 
                        and medical educational purposes. OTS (Off the Shelf) was a project to increase the market share of KOSMOS app by <b>transferring from Bridge (EchoNous’ standalone device) to Android devices</b>, in which both landscape and 
                        portrait views needed to be supported. We took it as a great opportunity to solve the long-lived usability issues of the app by <b>designing new layouts while enhancing user experiences 
                        at the same time</b>. Among them, Exam Review was the section with the most issues, where <b>user flow, interaction, and visual design were all improved</b>.

                      <p>
                        In the beginning, I clarified the ultrasound exam user workflow with PMs and other designers. I realized that <b>KOSMOS supported ultrasound scans focusing on two main user types – medical technicians 
                        and students/researchers</b>. For the first type, there were two main scenarios – emergency use cases and regular exams. 
                       </p>   


                       <p>
                        While conducting an exam, medical technicians may start with creating a patient profile or an exam profile, or start with ultrasound scanning directly. They would save images and clips, and add annotations 
                        later or instantly. After completing scanning, <b>they would review/edit/fill in patient info and exam info before archiving the data to PACS (Picture archiving and communication systems)</b>. 
                       </p>   


                       <p>
                        As for students and researchers, they scan for exercises/assignments and education/studies. Their workflows were similar to medical technicians, but <b>creating patient and exam profiles were not required</b>. 
                        They may <b>do more data management works, such as filtering, tagging, and deleting</b>. Eventually, they would <b>export data to a USB drive or to the MedEd online platform</b>, which is <b>an educational cloud service for exam 
                        review and management</b> (for both operators and reviewers) provided by EchoNous.
                       </p>

                        still couple of usability issues (user flow, interaction design, and visual design issues) to be solved based on discussions with designers and researchers. The main issues were located in the six pages below:

                            Since Exam Review existed in both KOSMOS Andriod apps and KOSMOS Bridge, the <b>new design had to be able to work on both landscape view and portrait view of KOSMOS Andriod apps, as well as the KOSMOS Bridge view</b> (1920 x 1200 px = 1280 x 800 dp in hdpi).
                            In exam review, the functionalities supported in KOSMOS Bridge shall be applied to KOSMOS Andriod apps as well.

                     <p>
                        Following the above design decisions, I created mockups to visualize ideas and <b>refined the design based on the feedback collected from design critique sessions with designers and PMs</b>.

                                    members' feedback, the first version was not obvious enough, and the second version was close to the sensitive area of the tag feature and would block a certain degree of the thumbnail

                                    more intuitive and smooth. The selection was applied to not only the delete action, but also the archive and export features. Users would be able to <b>archive and export all images/clips or the selected images/clips</b>.

                                    As for the export feature, in the first version, we wanted to differentiate "selection" and "tag," so only exporting selected images/clips were supported. However, we later realized that <b>making the 
                                    tagged images/clips exportable might be more convenient for users</b>. Therefore, I changed the design to support both of them and <b>added icons in front of the selections to help users quickly tell the 
                                    difference between these two</b>.
